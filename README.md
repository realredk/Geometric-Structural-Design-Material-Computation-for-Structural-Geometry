# Geometric-Structural-Design-Material-Computation-for-Structural-Geometry

## Course Overview
This project is developed as part of the "Material Computation for Structural Geometry" course, instructed by Masoud Akbarzadeh. The project focuses on novel geometric methods of structural design using 2D and 3D graphical statics. The main emphasis is on understanding the geometric representation of internal and external equilibrium forces and designing material tectonics based on the flow of forces in the system.

## Project Description
The aim of this project is to create a three-dimensional nodal connection that handles forces coming from three different directions and angles. This involves computational methods and material considerations to design efficient and innovative architectural structures, particularly through the manipulation and construction of spatial node geometry.

## Software Requirements
- **Rhinoceros 3D (Version 6.0 or higher)**: Necessary for running the provided GSD Model.gh script. [Download Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/download)
- **Grasshopper**: Automatically included with Rhino versions 6.0 and higher.
- **PolyFrame 2**: Developed by Dr. Masoud Akbarzadeh, this plugin is essential for the project. [Download PolyFrame](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/polyframe-2)

## Installation
1. **Install Rhinoceros 3D**: Ensure you have version 6.0 or higher.
2. **Install PolyFrame 2**: Follow the installation instructions provided with the download.

## Usage
- **GSD Model.gh**: This Grasshopper script is the core of the project. By modifying the input directions, you can generate designs for the required connection nodes.
- **Customizing the Script**: To adapt the node design to different conditions, adjust the input parameters within the Grasshopper script.

## Example Nodes
The `photo examples` folder contains rendered images of various node designs tested during the project. These examples demonstrate the capabilities and aesthetic considerations of the computational design processes used.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository and explore your own designs. Contributions to improve the script or extend the examples are welcome. Please submit pull requests with your enhancements.
